# SEQUENCE LEARNING 
# Motorcyclist Safety System with AI 

This project has been developed to put an approach to avoid deadly motorcycle accidents. Everyday, due to the motor accidents, thousands of people die or get disabled. 
These accidents are happening both from the carelessness of the bikers and the carelessness of the drivers. 

Although, We all know that motorcyclists are much more open to getting an impact from an accident, companies still dont put the enough afford to decrease the numbers.   
# We hope to give companies a good starting point
